# HTML A to Z

### Introduction

- Markup Languages

> Markup languages are systems for annotating text in a way that makes it readable by both humans and computers. They use tags to define elements within a document, specifying how the text should be structured, formatted, and displayed. For example, HTML uses tags like `<p>` for paragraphs and `<h1>` for headings to structure web content, while XML uses custom tags to define data structures for various applications.

- Frontend Development

> Frontend development is the practice of creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It focuses on the parts of a website that users directly interact with, such as buttons, text, images, and navigation menus. Frontend developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build these interactive elements and ensure they are visually appealing and function correctly across different devices and browsers.

- HTML

> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links using tags. Web browsers interpret these tags to display the content to users.

- CSS

> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It controls things like the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of web pages, ensuring a consistent and appealing user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- JavaScript

> JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic effects within web browsers. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, updating content dynamically, controlling multimedia, animating images, and much more, enhancing the user experience beyond static HTML and CSS.
